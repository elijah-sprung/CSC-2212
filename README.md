# CSC-2212
All of my code from my CSC-2212 programming class.

This is a repository with all code written during my time in the course CSC-2212, which is the Database Systems course for Computer Science at High Point University.

Homework was used to test how well a student could use SQL code to perform very specific class. The dump for an entire database is also included as a final project.
